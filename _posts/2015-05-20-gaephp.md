After the recent major updates to the Google App Engine PHP Runtime, we are putting up forks for some of the popular PHP framework starter apps.  These forks contain the modifications for running the apps on App Engine.

[This repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/symfony-standard) contains a modified Symfony Standard Edition Starter app for Google App Engine.

[This repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/laravel) contains a modified Laravel Starter app for Google App Engine.

To get started with either one, see the README in the repo.

You'll want to first create a Google Cloud project if you don't already have one. You can do that from [this page](https://console.developers.google.com/start/appengine) if you like.  (Note that there is a [free trial](https://console.developers.google.com/billing/freetrial) available).

Then, if you're not familiar with PHP on App Engine, you might want to follow the [PHP Tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/php/gettingstarted/introduction) first.

We're looking forward to your feedback (and/or pull requests)!
