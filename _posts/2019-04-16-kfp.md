If you've used [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/), you may know that its [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/jupyter/) installation makes it easy to deploy a [Kubeflow Pipeline](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/) directly from a notebook, using the [Pipelines SDK](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/sdk/).
[This notebook](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/samples/notebooks/Lightweight%20Python%20components%20-%20basics.ipynb), and others in that directory, show examples of how you can do that.
The [Pipelines Dashboard](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/pipelines-quickstart/), which is part of the Kubeflow Dashboard, makes it easy to upload and run pipelines as well.

Sometimes, though, you want to deploy a Kubeflow Pipeline remotely, from outside the Kubeflow cluster. Maybe you want to do this via execution of a command-line script on your local laptop; or from a VM that's outside the Kubeflow cluster (like the [AI Platform notebooks](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/mlengine/notebooks/instances?project=aju-vtests2)); or from services like [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/), or [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/) (which let you support event-triggered pipelines until that feature is available natively).

Remote deployment works well, but to implement it, you need to do a bit more setup to create the client connection to Kubeflow Pipelines than you would if you were connecting from within the same Kubeflow cluster. 

For example, the [Kubeflow 'click-to-deploy' web app](https://deploy.kubeflow.cloud/#/deploy), which makes it easy to install Kubeflow on GKE, includes the option to set up a [Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)-enabled cluster](https://cloud.google.com/iap/).  Connecting remotely to an IAP-enabled cluster requires configuring and using a
*service account* with the correct permissions.

I've created a series of notebooks that walk through how to do the necessary setup for remote deployment in three different contexts:

- [kfp_remote_deploy.ipynb](https://github.com/amygdala/examples/blob/cookbook/cookbook/pipelines/notebooks/kfp_remote_deploy.ipynb) shows how to do remote Pipelines deployment to an IAP-enabled Kubeflow installation (on GKE).
- [kfp_remote_deploy-no-IAP.ipynb](https://github.com/amygdala/examples/blob/cookbook/cookbook/pipelines/notebooks/kfp_remote_deploy-no-IAP.ipynb) walks through how to connect via port-forwarding to the cluster.   
**Note**: port-forwarding can be convenient for development, but is discouraged in a production context.
- [gcf_kfp_trigger.ipynb](https://github.com/amygdala/examples/blob/cookbook/cookbook/pipelines/notebooks/gcf_kfp_trigger.ipynb) gives an example of how you can use
[GCF (Cloud Functions)](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) to support event-triggering of a Pipeline deployment.

Give them a try and let me know what you think!
