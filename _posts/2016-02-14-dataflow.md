There's been a lot happening with [Google Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/) lately.

We are pleased to announce the recent induction of the [Google Cloud Dataflow SDK](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/what-is-google-cloud-dataflow#Sdks) (and corresponding runners for [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) and [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/)) into the new [Apache Beam incubator project](http://beam.incubator.apache.org/).

A ['Streaming 102'](http://oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-102) article was published by O'Reilly , following 
['Streaming 101'](http://oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-101).  These articles provide a great overview of design and implementation considerations in stream data analysis.

Weâ€™ve also recently written an article that [compares the programming models of Dataflow and Spark as they exist today](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/blog/dataflow-beam-and-spark-comparison), based on a mobile 'gaming' scenario, involving the evolution of a pipeline from a simple batch use case to more sophisticated streaming use cases, with side-by-side code snippets contrasting the two.
The article uses a suite of 'gaming' example pipelines that can be found in the [Dataflow github repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK/tree/master/examples/src/main/java8/com/google/cloud/dataflow/examples/complete/game).
